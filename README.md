MSA Transportation Demand

This is a project which I'm using to develop my python skills foremost. Taking a static dataset, dynamically manipulating it, and presenting it in a meaningful way.

Metropolitian Statistical Areas are designated by the US Census and include cities of a region. data of the population is gathered and sorted by region, MSA.
I use the population data and plug it into an rudimentary gravitic model. Then, it's expressed on a map as a line with a thickness dictated by the demand expected by the gravity model.
